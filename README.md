# Bookmark Changer Chrome Extension
## End Goal:
To create a Google Chrome extension that lets the user select a given bookmark. Every time the user clicks on this app's icon, it will update the url of that bookmark to the url of that tab.
## Why?
* So I can keep track of what strip of a webcomic I am on.
* Improve Javascript skills
* Learn more about Google's API
* Learn how to create Chrome extensions

## Current Status:

It is almost ready to be used by other people. I still have to pass the id of the folder of bookmarks, but now, it creates all of the buttons based on the things in that folder, rather than me creating the buttons and creating linking them to the bookmarks manually, which was a real pain.
