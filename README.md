## End Goal:
To create a Google Chrome extension that lets the user select a given bookmark. Every time the user clicks on this app's icon, it will update the url of that bookmark to the url of that tab.
## Why?
* So I can keep track of what strip of a webcomic I am on.
* Improve Javascript skills
* Learn more about Google's API
* Learn how to create Chrome extensions

## Current Status:

It is almost ready to be used by other people. The search functionality has been added, but it doesn't lead to anything. That's the next step: Allow the search to actually do something. Once that's done, Chrome Web Store here we come!
