# Bookmark Changer Chrome Extension
## End Goal:
To create a Google Chrome extension that lets the user select a given bookmark. Every time the user clicks on this app's icon, it will update the url of that bookmark to the url of that tab.
## Why?
* So I can keep track of what strip of a webcomic I am on.
* Improve Javascript skills
* Learn more about Google's API
* Learn how to create Chrome extensions

## Current Status:

It works for me. I may add a feature to choose bookmarks rather than having them natively in the code, but I'm good for now.
