# Bookmark Changer Chrome Extension
## End Goal:
To create a Google Chrome extension that lets the user select a given bookmark. Every time the user clicks on this app's icon, it will update the url of that bookmark to the url of that tab.
## Why?
* So I can keep track of what strip of a webcomic I am on.
* Improve Javascript skills
* Learn more about Google's API
* Learn how to create Chrome extensions

## Current Status:

It's basically ready. I'll be making some touchups here and there, but otherwise, it does exactly what I want it to do, and is completely functional for any user. There is now functionality for removing individual bookmarks and folders instead of clearing all. Info page to be added soon as well. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. It's on the CHROME WEBSTORE, BABY!
